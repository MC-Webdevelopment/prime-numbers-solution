# Solution to the prime numbers lab

This is one potential solution to the prime numbers lab. It builds upon the fact that all non-prime numbers (composite numbers) are built from (2,3,5, and 7). 

## Examples: 
- 9 (not prime) = 3 * 3
- 10 (not prime) = 5 * 2
- 11 (prime) = no two numbers can make this number
- 12 (not prime) = 2 * 2 * 3
- 13 (prime) = no two numbers can make this number
- 14 (not prime) = 2 * 7
- etc..


Test it out! Try different numbers :D
